# character-fight
First little project using PHP Object-Oriented Programming !

Create, modify and delete characters with damage they can take.
Characters have all no damage at the start and when they reache 100 damage points, they will be dead and 
deleted of the database.
Confront them and win the battle !

All characters are saved in a database.
